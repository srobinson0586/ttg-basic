## C Overview
C is a prominent general-purpose, procedural compiled programming language. 
- **Procedural** - Code is written as a sequence of in order instructions using a top-down approach. 
- **Compiled** - To execute code, you must compile it beforehand.  

## C Features
Some general C features are as follows:
- **Memory Management** - C supports dynamic memory allocation, allowing programmers to manually allocate memory at runtime. 
- **Pointers** - C has pointers which store the memory address of a variable. This enables easy access of data in allocated memory.
