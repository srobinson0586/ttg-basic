# Implement simple functions in C

JQR Addressed: Implement functionality of specific, predefined C functions to demonstrate knowledge of control flow, variables, calling functions, sanitizing user input, reading from files, creating and using libraries, documenting code, and utilizing man pages

Platform:  Linux

Code: [Makefile](./Makefile), [exercise.h](./exercise.h), [exercise.c](./exercise.c), [main.c](./main.c), and [userInputTests.txt](./userInputTests.txt)

Requirements: `gcc` and `valgrind` or `Visual Studio`

### Purpose

- This assignment will introduce you to programming in C.

- By the end of this competency, you should have a basic understanding of:
  - control flow
  - variables
  - calling functions
  - sanitizing user input
  - reading from files
  - creating and using libraries
  - documenting code
  - utilizing `man` pages

- Trainees will be expected to explain these concepts to the Training Lead or a qualified signer.

- This assignment is the basic building block for future competencies.

- Ensure the trainee has a strong understanding of GDB for troubleshooting.

### Assignment

- Complete the implementations for the functions located in [exercise.c](./exercise.c)

- Test your implementations by typing the following in the terminal:

    ```bash
    $ make
    ```

- Declare the following C data types and include their sizes on the side. `short, int, float, char, double, long, WORD, DWORD, QWORD`
  ```text

    ```

- Ensure you have the all of the given files in your current directory

### Completion

- [ ] Running `make` prints success
- [ ] Program has no memory leaks
- [ ] Program has no warnings
