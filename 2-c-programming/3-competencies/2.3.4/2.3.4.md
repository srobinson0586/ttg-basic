# Implement a State Machine with a signal handler

## Purpose

This assignment is meant to introduce you to state machines and signal
handling in Linux.

## Assignment

Implement a state machine with 2 states.
- The state machine should continuously cycle through the letters of the
  alphabet, printing one each second.
- In its initial state, the machine should print each letter in lowercase.
- In the other state, the machine should print each letter in uppercase.
- The machine should toggle between the states when it receives the
  `SIGTSTP` signal (generated by pressing Ctrl-z).
- Use the `signal` system call to register your signal handler (the man
  page recommends using the more portable sigaction, but don't worry about
  this unless you've got extra time and are extra motivated).
