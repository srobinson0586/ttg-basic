# Demonstrate understanding of complex, nested structs

[Back to OVERVIEW](../../README.md)

Starter code: [exercise.h](./exercise.h), [main.c](./main.c)

Requirements:  `gcc` and `valgrind` or `Visual Studio`

## Purpose

- This assignment assesses your ability to traverse nested structures and manage complex memory layouts.

- By the end of this competency, you should have a basic understanding of:
  - malloc/calloc
  - free
  - complex structure traversal

- Trainees will be expected to explain these concepts to the Training Lead or a qualified signer.

- Use GDB to troubleshoot your program.


## Assignment

- Must make use of the CAR and PERSON structures as well as their substructures
  - All instances of such structures must exist wholly on the heap

- All allocated memory must be managed appropriately.

- Test your implementations by typing the following in the terminal or building and running in Visual Studio:

    ```bash
    $ make
    ```

- Do not access the "hidden" subdirectory in the code section

- Ensure you have the all of the given files in your current directory

## Completion

- [ ] Correctly determine and print the requested fields from the CAR and PASSENGER structures

- [ ] All instances of ```CAR``` and ```PERSON``` are dynamically allocated and freed

- [ ] Program has no memory leaks

- [ ] Program has no warnings
