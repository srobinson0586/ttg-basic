# Explain and demonstrate understanding of endianness

[Back to OVERVIEW](../../README.md)

- Explain endianness.

    ```text
     ANSWER:
    ```

- What is the difference between big-endian and little-endian?

    ```text
     big-endian:
     little-endian:
    ```

- For each variable, write out what would be displayed in memory, given the endianness and the data type.  Assume each variable is assigned the memory address of 0x1000.

    ```c
    int a = 0x12345678;
    char b = 0x11;
    short c = 0x4142;
    ```

| Variable      | 0x1000 | 0x1001 | 0x1002 | 0x1003 |
| ------------- |:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| a (big)       |  |  |  |  |
| a (little)    |  |  |  |  |
| b (big)       |  |  |  |  |
| b (little)    |  |  |  |  |
| c (big)       |  |  |  |  |
| c (little)    |  |  |  |  |
