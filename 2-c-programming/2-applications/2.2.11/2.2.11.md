# Explain pointer arithmetic in C

- Explain how pointer arithmetic works.

    ```text
     ANSWER:
    ```

```c
int myInt[4] = { 0 };
int *intPtr = myInt;

myInt[0] = 1;
myInt[1] = 3;
myInt[2] = 3;
myInt[3] = 7;
```

- If the memory address of `myInt` is `0x1000`, what are the values of:

    ```c
    *intPtr =
    intPtr =
    *(intPtr + 2) =
    intPtr + 3 =
    ```
