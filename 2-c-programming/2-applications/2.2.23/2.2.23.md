# Explain and demonstrate bitwise operations

- Describe the following bitwise operators.

    ```text
    &  :
    |  :
    ^  :
    ~  :
    << :
    >> :
    ```

- Complete the following bitwise operations (these are cummulative).

    ```text
    char x = 0110 0100
    x = x & 1111 0001
    x = x | 0101 0110
    x = x ^ 0110 1001
    x = ~x
    x = x << 3
    x = x >> 2
    ```
