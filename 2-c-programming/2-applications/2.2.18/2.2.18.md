# Demonstrate usage of gdb

Code: [to_debug.c](./to_debug.c)

- In [to_debug.c](./to_debug.c), during the first call to `func` on `line31`, what is the type of the argument we are pasing to `func`?

    ```text
    ANSWER:
    ```

- Using the debugger, describe the relationship between `x` and `y`.

    ```text
    x:
    y:
    ```

- With those values, complete the memory diagram below.  Assume position in code to be `line30`.

|  address   |     value     | variable  name| type |
|:----------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:----:|
| 0xFFFFFFFC |               |   x           |      |
| 0xFFFFFFF8 |               |   z           |      |
| 0xFFFFFFF4 |               |   y           |      |

- What values will those variables have on `line32`?

|  address   |     value     | variable  name| type |
|:----------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:----:|
| 0xFFFFFFFC |               |   x           |      |
| 0xFFFFFFF8 |               |   z           |      |
| 0xFFFFFFFC |               |   y           |      |

- Why does the second call to `func` fail?

    ```text
     ANSWER:
    ```

- Exactly which instruction within `func` causes the failure?

    ```text
     ANSWER:
    ```

- [ ] Modify the second call to `func` such that it executes appropriately with the desired effect.

- On the line that reads `strings s = {0}`, what is the size of `s` on a 32-bit system?

    ```text
     ANSWER:
    ```

- What would be the size of `s` on a 64-bit system?

    ```text
     ANSWER:
    ```

- What are the types of `s.a` and `s.b`?

    ```text
    s.a:
    s.b:
    ```
- [ ] With the use of a `memcpy` instruction, modify [to_debug.c](./to_debug.c) such that `SUCCESS!` is printed to the console.

- Why does `memcpy` succeed, while a direct assignment fails?

    ```text
     ANSWER:
     ```
