- Given each scenario, complete the following tables by filling in the values for
  each variable as they would be immediately before line 52 is executed in each
  iteration of the `for` loop starting on line 43.

## Scenario 1

- The user inputs `hello` and presses `enter`

| counter | *buf | size |
|:-------:|:----:|:----:|
|    0    |      |      |
|         |      |      |
|         |      |      |
|         |      |      |
|         |      |      |
|         |      |      |

- What will the values of the following variables be on line 62?

| counter | *buf | size | *bytesRead |
|:-------:|:----:|:----:|:----------:|
|         |      |      |            |

## Scenario 2

- The user inputs `A` 2048 times and presses `enter`. What will the values of
  the following variables be before line 52 of the last 2 complete iterations
  of the `for` loop?

| counter | *buf | size |
|:-------:|:----:|:----:|
|    0    |  'A' |      |
|    1    |  'A' |      |
|   ...   |  ... |      |
|         |      |      |
|         |      |      |

- What will the values of the following variables be on line 62?


| counter | *buf | size | *bytesRead |
|:-------:|:----:|:----:|:----------:|
|         |      |      |            |
