# Write a Makefile to compile a project

- Create a Makefile with the following targets:

    1. `lib_tools.a`: creates a static library using the file [lib_tools.c](./lib_tools.c)
    2. `all`: creates an executable called `main` from [my_tools.c](./my_tools.c) and `lib_tools.a`
    3. `clean`: deletes the executable and any target or object files created by the makefile
    4. `run`: runs the executable

- Ensure you have the correct dependencies.
