# Explain the differences between the stack and the heap

- What is the stack and what is it used for?

    ```text
    ANSWER:
    ```

- What is the heap and what is it used for?

    ```text
    ANSWER:
    ```

- What are the differences between the two?

    ```text
    Stack:
    Heap:
    ```

- What is the memory map of a C program?

    ```text

    ```

## Interpret Memory

```c
typedef struct _POINT {
  int x;
  int y;
} POINT;

typedef struct _LINE {
  POINT point_one;
  POINT point_two;
} LINE;
```

- variable declarations

```c
LINE stack_line;
LINE *heap_line = calloc(1, sizeof(LINE));
```

- stack memory

|  address   | value| variable name |
|:----------:|:----:|:-------------:|
| 0xFFFFDF4C | 0x10 | |
| 0xFFFFDF48 | 0x21 | |
| 0xFFFFDF44 | 0x01 | |
| 0xFFFFDF40 | 0x00 | LINE stack_line |
| 0xFFFFDF3C | 0x1000 | LINE* heap_line |

- heap memory

|      | 00 | 01 | 02 | 03 | 04 | 05 | 06 | 07 | 08 | 09 | 0A | 0B | 0C | 0D | 0E | 0F |
|------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
|0x1000| 05 | 00 | 00 | 00 | 10 | 00 | 00 | 00 | 01 | 00 | 00 | 00 | 20 | 00 | 00 | 00 |

- Complete the table below using the above code and memory diagram.

| variable | value |
|:--------:|:-----:|
| stack_line.point1.x |  |
| stack_line.point1.y |  |
| stack_line.point2.x |  |
| stack_line.point2.y |  |
| heap_line->point1.x |  |
| heap_line->point1.y |  |
| heap_line->point2.x |  |
| heap_line->point2.y |  |

- What is the difference between _LINE and LINE?

    ```text
    ANSWER:
    ```
