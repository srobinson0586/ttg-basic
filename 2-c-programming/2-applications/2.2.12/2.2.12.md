# Explain and demonstrate usage of arrays and structs

[Back to OVERVIEW](../../README.md)

- Code: [structs.c](./structs.c) and [structs.h](./structs.h)

- What is a structure in c?

    ```text
     ANSWER:
    ```

- What is an enumeration in c?

    ```text
    ANSWER:
    ```

- Just as the notation `var++` is shorthand for `var = var + 1` in c, the notation `mystruct->field` is shorthand for what?

    ```text
     ANSWER:
    ```

- What is a buffer in c?

    ```text
    ANSWER:
    ```

- What is an array in c? How does it relate to generic buffers?

    ```text
     ANSWER:
    ```

- What is the difference between these two buffers:

    ```c
    char array_buffer[3] = {'a','b','c'};

    char* generic_buffer = (char*)malloc(3*sizeof(char));
    generic_buffer[0] = 'a';
    generic_buffer[1] = 'b';
    generic_buffer[2] = 'c';
    ```

    ```text
     ANSWER:
    ```

- Just as the notation `var++` is shorthand for `var = var + 1` in c, the notation `array[i]` is shorthand for what?

    ```text
     ANSWER:
    ```

- Complete TODOs in [structs.c](./structs.c). Use GDB to troubleshoot.
