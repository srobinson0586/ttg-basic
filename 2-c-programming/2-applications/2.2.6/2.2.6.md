# Explain and demonstrate understanding of type-casting

- Explain type casting.

```text

```

- What is the difference between Multi-byte and Unicode character sets?

```text

```

- What will be printed out on the last line (assume the system is little
  endian)?

```c
    long* ptr = malloc(4);
    ((char*) ptr)[0] = 1;
    ((char*) ptr)[1] = 2;
    ((char*) ptr)[2] = 0;
    ((char*) ptr)[3] = 0;
    printf("int value = %d\n", *(int*) ptr);
```

```text
int value =
```

- Explain in detail the purpose of the `char*` and `int*` casts in the
  code above. In other words, what would happen if we didn't use the casts?

```text

```
