# Implement getline

Code: [my_getline.c](./my_getline.c)

Implement a `my_getline` function that has the same function signature and behavior as getline. Refer to the man pages as a reference. Use GDB and Valgrind to troubleshoot your program.

Compile your code with the test harness by running 'make'. You can then test it on the small file 'test.txt' by running just './getline'. You can test it against a large randomly-generated text file by running './getline rand'.
