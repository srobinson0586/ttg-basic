# Explain functionality of gdb commands

There is an expectation that you will use GDB on nearly every single assignment throughout this course and every time you write C code. The more comfortable you are in GDB, the stronger of a programmer you will be.

- Explain what the following gdb commands do (`command <arguments> (command's shorthand):`)

```text
step (s):

next (n):

disassemble <location> (disass):

break <location> (b):

info <breakpoints/locals/args/...> (i):

print <location> (p):

x/[n][f][u] <addr>:

delete <number> (d):

finish:

$<register>:

quit (q):

run (r):

help (h):

list (l):

```
