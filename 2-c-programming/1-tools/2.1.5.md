# Explain memory checking with Valgrind

[Back to OVERVIEW](../README.md)

The following are tools in Linux and Windows which assist in identifying memory leaks, memory overwrites, race conditions, etc. in C.

## Valgrind

- Compile the following program and run it with Valgrind:

```bash
$ gcc -g my_file.c -o my_file
$ valgrind --leak-check=full ./my_file
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
  int* my_nums = malloc(3);

  my_nums[0] = 1;
  my_nums[1] = 2;
  my_nums[2] = 3;

  printf("My Numbers: %d %d %d\n", my_nums[0], my_nums[1], my_nums[2]);

  free(my_nums);

        return 0;
}
```
