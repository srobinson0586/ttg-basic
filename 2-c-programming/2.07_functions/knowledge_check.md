# C Programming Functions - Knowledge Check

[Back to README](README.md)

1. What is a function in C, and what is the purpose of the **main()** function?
   - A) A function is a group of variables in C, and the **main()** function initializes them.
   - B) A function is a group of statements that perform a specific task. The **main()** function is the entry point of a C program.
   - C) A function is a keyword in C used to define variables. The **main()** function defines the program's structure.
```ANSWER:
```

2. How does C programming handle function calls, and what happens when a function is called?
   - A) C programs execute functions in a random order, and the called function returns control to the caller immediately.
   - B) When a function is called, program control is transferred to the called function, and it returns control to the caller upon completion.
   - C) Function calls are ignored in C programs, as they don't affect the program's flow.
```
ANSWER:
```

3. What is the difference between "call by value" and "call by reference" when passing arguments to a function in C?
   - A) "Call by value" copies the address of an argument into the function, while "call by reference" copies the actual value.
   - B) "Call by value" copies the actual value into the function, and changes to the parameter affect the argument. "Call by reference" copies the address.
   - C) "Call by value" copies the actual value into the function, but changes to the parameter do not affect the argument. "Call by reference" copies the address and allows changes to the argument.
