   int b = 20;
   int c = a * b / 5;
   ```
   
```
ANSWER:

4. Determine the value of `b` after executing the following code:
   ```c
   int a = 15;
   int b = a++;
   ```
   
```
ANSWER:

```

5. Find the result of the following bitwise operation:
   ```c
   int x = 10; // Binary: 1010
   int y = 6;  // Binary: 0110
   int result = x | y;
   ```

```
ANSWER:

```

6. Evaluate the following expression and find the value of `result`:
   ```c
   int result = 5 + 10 * 2 - 8 / 4;
   ```

```
ANSWER:

```

7. Calculate the value of `value` in the following expression:
   ```c
   int a = 7;
   int b = 3;
   int value = (a + b) * (a - b) / (a % b);
   ```

```
ANSWER:

```

8. Determine the output of the following code:
   ```c
   int x = 5;
   int y = 7;
   int z = (x > y) ? x + y : x - y;
   printf("Value of z is %d\n", z);
   ```

```
ANSWER:

```

9. **Problem:** Calculate the result of the following expression:
   ```c
   int a = 15;
   int b = 7;
   int result = a % b;
   ```
   
```
ANSWER:

```

10. **Problem:** Increment the value of `x` by 5 using the increment operator:
   ```c
   int x = 10;
   ```
   
```
ANSWER:

```

11. **Problem:** Calculate the absolute value of an integer `num` using the conditional operator (ternary operator). If `num` is negative, negate it; otherwise, leave it unchanged.
   ```c
   int num = -8;
   ```
   
```
ANSWER:
```
