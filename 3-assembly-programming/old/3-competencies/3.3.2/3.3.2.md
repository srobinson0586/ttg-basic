# Implement linked lists in assembly

This competency will apply your skill in assembly programming to a unified
project. This is a much more realistic application than just writing a bunch
of smaller, unrelated functions, as you did in previous competencies. It will
also introduce you to working with structs in assembly.

Your task is to complete the implementation of the linked list by completing
the TODOs in [linked_list.asm](./linked_list.asm).

[test.c](./test.c) contains the `main` function and tests your code. Compile
the project by running `make`, and then run it under Valgrind.
