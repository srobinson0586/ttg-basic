# Demonstrate understanding of assembly prologues and epilogues

[Back to OVERVIEW](../../README.md)

Code: [sum.c](./sum.c)

- Using [sum.c](./sum.c), code the cdecl function prologue and epilogue for the `sum` function (assume no FPO).

    ```assembly
    ; prologue:


    ; epilogue:

    ```

- How would you reference the variable `x` in assembly?

    ```text
    x:
    ```

- How would you reference the parameter `b` in assembly?

    ```text
    b:
    ```

- Would there be any differences in referencing `x` or `b` if `sum` used the following calling conventions?

    ```text
    stdcall:
    fastcall:
    x64 Windows:
    x64 Linux:
    ```
