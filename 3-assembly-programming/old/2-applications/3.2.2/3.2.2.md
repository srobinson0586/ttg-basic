# Explain usage of specific registers

- Discuss the traditional importance of the following registers.  Do they always perform those operations or can they be used for general purpose?

    ```text
    rip:
        general purpose register (y/n)?
    rbp:
        general purpose register (y/n)?
    rsp:
        general purpose register (y/n)?
    rax:
        general purpose register (y/n)?
    xmm0:
        general purpose register (y/n)?
    r9:
        general purpose register (y/n)?
    ```

- What are their 32-bit equivalents?

    ```text
     rip:
     rbp:
     rsp:
     rax:
    xmm0:
      r9:
    ```
