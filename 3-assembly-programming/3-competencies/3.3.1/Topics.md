- Basics
    - Syntax
    - Functions
    - Labels, local labels
    - Exporting labels with `GLOBAL`
    - Special symbols like `$`
- Control flow
    - signed vs unsigned jmp
    - iterating through array
- Registers
    - Different sizes (`al`, `ah`, `ax`, `eax`, `rax`)
    - Sign Extend vs Zero Extend, what's default
- Arithmetic operations
- Calling functions
    - Linux x86 and x86_64 calling convention
        - Perhaps briefly mention difference to windows
    - Returning information
        - Through input ptrs, `rax`
    - Systems calls (`write`, `open`, `close`) for `lab3_5`
    - Stack alignment in Windows (useful, not required)
        - Briefly mention how some windows internal functions will **crash** on `movabs` and similar instructions if the stack isn't aligned
        - *Not relevant for the competency* but a brief aside for Windows-leaning individuals could be good to stoke curiosity
- Pointers
    - Specifying *type* (size)
    - Reading from
    - Writing to
    - Working with strings specifically
- Linking
    - How snippets coded in Assembly can be called from C programs
    - How linker finds the correct place to call
    - Using external functions like `strncpy` in `lab3_4`
        - Its a simple `call` but could be useful to talk about the `extern` symbol
- Tools 
    - `gdb`
    - `valgrind`
    - `strance`
    - Looking up assembly instructions details
        - geoff-chapelle, instruction manual, know what stackoverflow articles apply to you, etc
