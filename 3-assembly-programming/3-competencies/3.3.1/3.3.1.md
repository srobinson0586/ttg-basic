# Implement specific functions in assembly for Linux x64

Platform:  Linux

Code: [Makefile](./Makefile), [competency.asm](./competency.asm), and [main.c](./main.c)

Requirements: gcc, nasm, and Valgrind

### Purpose

- This assignment will introduce you to programming in x86_64 assembly in Linux.

- By the end of this competency, you should have a basic understanding of:
  - syntax
  - functions/labels
  - control flow
  - arithmetic operations
  - calling functions
  - pointers
  - system calls
  - creating/writing to files
  - strings

- Trainees will be expected to explain these concepts to the Training Lead or a qualified signer.

- Trainees will use gdb, Valgrind, and strace to troubleshoot their assembly.

- This assignment is the basic building block for future competencies.

### Assignment

- Complete the implementations for the functions located in `verifier.asm`

- Test your implementations by runnning `make` in the terminal.

### Completion

- [ ] Running `make` reports success
- [ ] gcc reports no compiler warnings
- [ ] Valgrind reports no errors or memory leaks
