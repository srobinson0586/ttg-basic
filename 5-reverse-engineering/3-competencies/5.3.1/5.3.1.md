# Reverse a binary and exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability

JQR Addressed: Reverse engineer and exploit a binary in order to demonstrate knowledge of buffer overflows, gdb, ghidra, function calls, and stack frames.

Platform:  Linux

Code: [reversin](./reversin)

Requirements: `gdb` and `ghidra`

## Purpose

- This assignment will introduce you to reverse engineering.

- By the end of this competency, you should have a basic understanding of:
  - buffer overflows
  - gdb
  - ghidra
  - function calls
  - stack frames

- Trainees will be expected to explain these concepts to the Training Lead or a qualified signer.

- This assignment is the basic building block for future competencies.

### Assignment

- Find the c library function call that causes the buffer overflow vulnerability in the program `reversin` using `ghidra`

    ```text
    ANSWER:
    ```

- What payload would you use to exploit the vulnerability in `reversin`?

    ```text
    PAYLOAD:
    ```

- Get the flag in `reversin` using `gdb`

    ```text
    FLAG:
    ```

### Completion

- [ ] Locates vulnerable function
- [ ] Explains how to exploit `reversin`
- [ ] Gets the flag
