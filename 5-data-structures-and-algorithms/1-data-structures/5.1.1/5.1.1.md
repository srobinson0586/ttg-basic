# Describe Linked Lists and Implement a Circularly Linked List in C

Requirements:
1. Read through this document and answer the questions in [TODO: Questions](#todo-questions) below
2. Complete the Circular Linked List Implementation in [circular_linked_list](./circular_linked_list/circular_linked_list.c)
   1. Ensure there are no memory leaks or compilation warnings by using the `run` target in the Makefile
   2. Add Macro guards to the header file

## Overview

A linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science and programming. It's a collection of elements, often called nodes, where each node contains both data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. 

Linked lists are used to create dynamic data structures that can efficiently insert or remove elements from any position within the list. You may look at other resources on this topic if desired. We recommend [YouTube - Intro to Linked List](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9PTBwOzceo).

Here are some key points to understand about linked lists:

1. **Node Structure:**
   1. Each node in a linked list typically consists of two parts:
      1.  Data, i.e. the object you are trying to keep track of
      2.  A reference (or pointer) to the next node
   2. The data can be any type of information, such as an integer, a string, or a complex object.

2. **Head and Tail:**
   1. Linked lists always have a "`head`" pointer, pointing to the first node
   2. Depending on the application specifics, a "`tail`" pointer pointing to the last node might be warranted
      1. This is useful when the linked lists are large and avoids having to traverse the entire list when looking for the end

3. **Dynamic Sizing:** 
   1. Linked lists are dynamic data structures
      1. This means they can easily grow or shrink in size as elements are added or removed
   2. This is in contrast to arrays, which typically have a fixed size
      1. *Unless you're a C genius like us NCWDG developers*

4. **Insertion and Deletion:**
   1. Linked lists excel at insertion and deletion operations
   2. Adding or removing a node involves changing a few references, rather than shifting elements like in an array.

5. **Memory Efficiency:**
   1. Linked lists *can be* more memory-efficient than arrays, especially when dealing with elements of different sizes
   2. However, they require additional memory per element for storing references

6. **Traversal:**
   1. To traverse a linked list, you start at the head (or tail, depending on your needs) and follow the links from node to node until you reach the desired position or the end of the list


## Types of Linked Lists

1. **Singly Linked List:**
   1. Each node points to the next node in the list, creating a **unidirectional sequence**
   2. The last node points to `null` to indicate the end of the list

2. **Doubly Linked List:** 
   1. Each node points to both the next and the previous nodes
   2. This **bidirectional link** allows for more efficient traversal in both directions but requires more memory for storing the extra references

3. **Circularly Linked List:**  
   1. Very similar to the Singly Linked List
   2. **However**, the last node's "next" pointer doesn't point to `null` but instead points back to the `head`, forming a closed loop 


## Example Uses

Linked lists are used in a variety of applications, such as:
- Implementing other data structures
  - e.g., stacks and queues
- Managing memory in operating systems
- Representing more complex data structures like graphs


## TODO: Questions
Consider the scenarios below. Determine which type of linked list would be used and why the other 2 types *would not be used*. You may use the following acronyms: "SLL" for Singly-Linked Lists, "DLL" for Doubly-Linked Lists, "CLL" for Circularly-Linked Lists. The choices for each question are:
- (A) Singly-Linked List
- (B) Doubly-Linked List
- (C) Circularly-Linked List

The first question is answered for you as an example

1. In a scenario where you need to navigate a playlist of songs sequentially and memory efficiency is crucial, which type of linked list should you use?
```
- (A) Singly-Linked List
   - Just as memory efficient as CLL, more than DLL. Don't use CLL because we need to know when we are done traversing the playlist.
```
