# Describe Stacks and Implement a Stack in C

[Back to OVERVIEW](../../README.md)

Requirements: 
1. Read through this document and answer the questions in [TODO: Questions](#todo-questions) below
2. Complete the Stack implementation in [stack.c](./stack/stack.c)
   1. Ensure there are no memory leaks or compilation warnings by using the `run` target in the Makefile
   2. Add Macro guards to the header file

## Overview

A stack is a linear (*not necessarily contiguous in memory*) data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order. This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. You may look at other resources on this topic if desired. We recommend [YouTube- Data Structures: Stacks and Queues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjI1WNcIntg&list=PLI1t_8YX-Apv-UiRlnZwqqrRT8D1RhriX&index=3).

Here's an explanation of the stack data structure:

- **Operations:** Stacks support two main operations:
  1. **Push:** This operation adds an element to the "top" of the stack.
  2. **Pop:** This operation removes the top element from the stack.

- **Top:**
  - Where elements are added and removed
  - It's the only directly accessible part of the stack

- **Empty Stack:**
  - A stack is considered empty when it contains no elements

- **Size:**
  - The number of elements in the stack is often referred to as the "size"

- **Complexity:**
  - The time complexity for both push and pop operations in a stack, no matter its underlying data structure (*array or linked list*) is O(1)


## Types of Stacks

- Stacks can be implemented using Arrays or Linked Lists
  - Arrays provide a simple and efficient implementation
  - Linked lists offer dynamic sizing but with slightly more overhead  

- A stack that does FIFO (first-in first-out) insertion and removal is simply called a `queue`
  - This essential data structure is covered in [7.1.3.md](./7.1.3.md)

## Example Uses

- Function call management (keeping track of function calls and returns)
- Compiler/Interpreter expression evaluation (e.g., evaluating arithmetic expressions)
- Backtracking algorithms (like depth-first search in graph theory)

## TODO: Questions

Analyze the C function below. Assume the following scenario:
  1. The program is ran as a 32-bit application on a x86_64 CPU running Linux
  1. The function is called from `Main()` with  `recursive_print("NCWDG");`
  2. The address of the instruction after the call in main is `0x700000AC`
  3. The address of the instruction after the `recursive_print` call within `recursive_print` (i.e. line 3 in the function) is `0x700000C4`
  4. The `"NCWDG"` string resides at address `0x40000000` in memory
  5. The `recursive_print` function resides at address `0x68000000` in memory

```c
void recursive_print(char* toPrint){
  if( *toPrint != '\0' ){
    recursive_print(toPrint+1);
    putchar(*toPrint);
  }
  return;
}
```

For each call to `recursive_print`, draw an ASCII diagram of the stack state as it first enters the function, **before the prologue is executed**. The first step has been drawn as an example. Ensure the following:
- Show the saved return address
- Show the arguments for the current call
- Show all the previous stack data *that are related to the recursive_print call*
  - Ignore any previous local variables, EBPs, etc pushed to the stack
- The top of the stack should always be at the bottom of the diagram (since stacks "grow towards lower addresses in memory")
- Only diagram up until the final call to `recursive_print` (`*toPrint == '\0'`)

> It might be beneficial to create an actual executable program out of this and then inspect its execution with GDB. Just remember to use the addresses specified in this scenario.

### Answers
- **What would the program print?**
  - ANSWER: ``
- Complete the diagrams as described above:

First call (`*toPrint == 'N'`):
```text
|  ..........  |
|  ..........  |
|  0x40000000  | // toPrint argument
|  0x700000AC  | // saved ret val
```

??? call (`*toPrint == '?'`):
```text
|  ??????????  |
|  ??????????  |
|  ??????????  | 
|  ??????????  | 
```
