# Describe Queues and Implement a Priority Queue in C

[Back to OVERVIEW](../../README.md)

Requirements: 
1. Read through this document and answer the questions in [TODO: Questions](#todo-questions) below
2. Complete the Priority Queue implementation in [priority_queue.c](./priority_queue/priority_queue.c)
   1. Ensure there are no memory leaks or compilation warnings by using the `run` target in the Makefile
   2. Add Macro guards to the header file

## Overview

A queue is a fundamental data structure in computer science that operates on a "first-in, first-out" (**FIFO**) principle. It's essentially a linear collection of elements where two primary operations occur: `enqueue` and `dequeue`. You may look at other resources on this topic if desired. We recommend [YouTube- Data Structures: Stacks and Queues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjI1WNcIntg&list=PLI1t_8YX-Apv-UiRlnZwqqrRT8D1RhriX&index=3).

Here's a breakdown of these operations and the core characteristics of a queue:

- Enqueue: 
  - This operation adds an element to the back of the queue
  - As a result, the new element becomes the last in line, and all existing elements maintain their relative order
  - Enqueueing is also referred to as "push" in some contexts

- Dequeue:
  - This operation removes and returns the element at the front of the queue
    - In other words, it extracts and processes the element that has been in the queue the longest
  - Dequeueing is also called "pop" or "shift" in some cases

- Front:
  - The element at the front of the queue, which will be the next element to be dequeued

- Rear (or Back):
  - It's the element at the back of the queue, which is the last in line

- Empty Queue:
  - A queue is considered empty when it contains no elements

- Size:
  - The number of elements in the queue is its size or length


## Types of Queues
There are various implementations of queues, including:

- Simple Queue:
  - A standard queue where elements are enqueued at the rear and dequeued from the front

- Priority Queue:
  - In this queue, elements have associated priorities, and the highest priority element is dequeued first
  - It's often used for tasks like scheduling in operating systems or implementing algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm

- Double-Ended Queue (Deque):
  - A deque allows elements to be enqueued and dequeued from both ends
    - This breaks the FIFO principle, allowing developers to do LIFO (Last-in First-Out)
  - This structure provides more flexibility, allowing you to perform tasks such as inserting elements at the front or back efficiently

- Circular Queue:
  - In a circular queue, the rear and front pointers wrap around the ends of the underlying array
  - This allows efficient space utilization, but you need to manage the circular aspect of it


## Example Uses
Queues are often used for tasks that involve managing items or processes in a sequential order. Some real-world examples include:

- Print job management, where the printer processes documents in the order they're sent.
- Task scheduling in an operating system, as tasks are executed in the order they're scheduled.
- Breadth-first search in graph algorithms, where nodes are explored in layers.
- Handling requests in web servers, following a first-come, first-served approach.


## TODO: Questions

1. Explain the difference between a simple Queue and a Priority Queue. Think of an example use case for each of them and indicate why the other kind wouldn't be used.
   - e.g. OS Thread Scheduling would use Priority Queues because simple queues don't allow for higher priority threads to take precedence.

2. Explain the effect of FIFO/LIFO in queues and for each of the above named types, indicate which principle they are able to use.
