   2. Add Macro guards to the header file

## Overview

A tree is a fundamental data structure in computer science and mathematics. It's a hierarchical structure that resembles an inverted tree with a root node at the top and branches that lead to other nodes. Trees are widely used to represent hierarchical data and relationships among elements.

Trees consist of nodes connected by edges or branches, and each node can have zero or more child nodes. You may look at other resources on this topic if desired. We recommend [YouTube- Data Structures: Trees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSWTXtMglKE&list=PLI1t_8YX-Apv-UiRlnZwqqrRT8D1RhriX&index=7).

Here are some key terms and concepts related to trees:

1. **Node:**
   1. Contains data and zero or more references (links) to child nodes

2. **Root:**
   1. The topmost node in a tree
   2. It serves as the starting point for traversing the tree

3. **Child:**
   1. A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root
   2. Each node can have multiple children

4. **Parent:**
    1. The converse notion of a child
    2. A node is the parent of its children

5. **Siblings:**
    1. Nodes with the same parent are called siblings

6. **Leaf:**
    1. A node with *no children*
    2. It's a terminal node in the tree

7. **Depth:**
    1. The length of the path from the root to a particular node

8. **Height:**
    1. The length of the longest path from a node (usually the root) to a leaf
    2. It's the depth of the deepest node

9.  **Subtree:**
    1. A tree that is part of a larger tree
    2. E.g.: If you cut a branch off a tree, the removed branch with its children is a subtree of the original tree.


## Types of Trees

- **Binary Tree:**
    - Each node has, *at most*, two children (left and right)
    - This structure is commonly used in binary search trees, expression trees, and more.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST):**
    - A binary tree with the property that each node's **left child contains values less than** the node, and each node's **right child contains values greater than** the node
    - This allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of elements
- **Balanced Tree:**
    - A tree where the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one
    - Examples include AVL trees and Red-Black trees.


## Example Uses

1. **File Systems:**
    - File systems in operating systems are often organized as tree structures. Directories or folders can contain files and other directories, forming a tree. This hierarchical structure makes it easy to navigate and manage files.

2. **Expression Trees:**
    - In compilers and interpreters, expression trees are used to represent mathematical expressions. They help in parsing and evaluating complex expressions efficiently. For instance, parsing and optimizing arithmetic expressions in programming languages.

3. **XML and HTML Parsing:**
    - Trees are used to parse and represent XML and HTML documents. Each element in the document forms a node in the tree, and the hierarchy is maintained.

4. **Game Development:**
    - In game development, trees are used for various purposes. For instance, scene graphs are used to represent objects in a game scene and their relationships. Decision trees are used for AI decision-making.

5. **Network Routing:**
    - Routing algorithms in computer networks often use tree structures to determine the most efficient path for data packets to travel.

6.  **AI and Decision Trees:**
    - In artificial intelligence, decision trees are used for classification and decision-making tasks. They are commonly used in machine learning algorithms for tasks like predicting outcomes and classifications.
