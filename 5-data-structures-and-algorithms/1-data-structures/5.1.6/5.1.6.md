# Describe Graphs

Requirements: Read through the material and answer the questions in [TODO: Questions](#todo-questions) below.

## Overview

A graph is a widely used data structure in computer science and mathematics. It's a collection of nodes or *vertices* connected by *edges*. Graphs can be used to represent various relationships, networks, or structures. You may look at other resources on this topic if desired. We recommend [YouTube- Intro to Graph Theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFKZLXVO-Dg).

There are several key  components of a graph:

- **Vertices (Nodes):**
  - These are the fundamental units of a graph
  - Each vertex typically represents an entity, object, or point of interest
  - e.g. in a social network graph, each person's profile might be represented as a vertex/node

- **Edges:**
  - Edges are the connections or relationships between nodes. They define how the vertices are related
    - e.g. In a social network, edges might represent friendships between people
  - Edges can be weighted to indicate the strength or cost of the relationship.

- **Direction:**
  - Graphs can be categorized into directed and undirected
  - Directed graph
    - Edges have a direction, meaning they go from one vertex to another
  - Undirected graph
    - Edges have no direction; they simply connect two vertices.

- **Cyclic or Acyclic:**
  - A graph can be cyclic or acyclic
  - Cyclic graph
    - The graph contains cycles or loops (a sequence of vertices that starts and ends at the same node)
  - Acyclic graph
    - There are no cycles

- **Connectedness:**
  - A graph can be connected or disconnected
  - Connected graph
    - Given *any two nodes* there exists a path between them, i.e. you can get from node A to node B
  - Disconnected graph
    - Some nodes are isolated from the rest of the graph


## Types of Graphs

- **Weighted Graphs:**
  - A type of graph where each edge has an associated numerical value called a "weight"
  - These weights can represent various factors, such as distances, costs, or any other relevant measurements
  - Weighted graphs are extensively used in a wide range of applications where the relationships between nodes involve quantitative data
    - e.g. A graph representing cities as nodes and the time needed to travel between as the weight of an edge
- **Tree:**
  - A connected acyclic graph with one node is designated as the root
- **Bipartite Graphs:**
  - Nodes can be divided into two sets, and edges connect nodes from different sets

## TODO: Questions

1. Imagine you are building a recommendation system for a social network. Explain how you would represent the user relationships in a graph. Would this be a weighted or unweighted graph, and why?
