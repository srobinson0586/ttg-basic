# Describe Hash Tables and Implement a Hash Table in C

Requirements:
1. Read through this document and answer the questions in [TODO: Questions](#todo-questions) below
2. Complete the Hash Table implementation in [hash_table.c](./hash_table/hash_table.c)
   1. Ensure there are no memory leaks or compilation warnings by using the `run` target in the Makefile
   2. Add Macro guards to the header file

## Overview

A hash table, AKA a hash map, is a popular data structure used for efficient data storage and retrieval. It offers fast data access by associating **keys** with **values**.  You may look at other resources on this topic if desired. We recommend [YouTube- Data Structures: Hash Tables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs0KM3wKv8).

Here's an explanation of hash tables:

**Components of a Hash Table:**
1. **Buckets:**
   1. A hash table is typically implemented as an array where each element is called a "bucket."

2. **Hash Function:**
   1. A function that takes a key and returns an index in the array where the corresponding value should be stored or retrieved
   2. The goal is to distribute key-value pairs evenly across the array

**How Hash Tables Work:**
1. **Storing Data:**
   1. You provide a key and a value
   2. The hash function takes the key, calculates the index in the array, and stores the value in that index

2. **Retrieving Data:**
   1. You supply the key
   2. The hash function calculates the index again and fetches the corresponding value


## Advantages of Hash Tables
- **Fast Access:**
  - Hash tables provide constant-time (`O(1)`) access to data on average
  - This means that regardless of the number of elements, you can quickly retrieve values

- **Versatility:**
  - Hash tables can store various types of data, including integers, strings, or custom objects

- **Scalability:**
  - They work well for handling large datasets, maintaining consistent performance


## Challenges and Considerations
- **Collisions:**
  - Hash functions may map different keys to the same index. This situation is called a *collision*
  - To handle collisions, hash tables use techniques like:
    - Open addressing: finding the next available bucket
    - Chaining: storing multiple key-value pairs in the same bucket

- **Hash Function Quality:** 
  - The effectiveness of a hash table relies heavily on the quality of the hash function
  - A good hash function minimizes collisions and evenly distributes data.


## Example Uses

- Hash tables are ideal for implementing associative arrays or dictionaries, where keys map to values
  - Ever heard of *Rainbow Table attacks*?
- They are frequently used in database indexing, caches, and symbol tables in compilers.
- Hash tables are integral to many programming languages and libraries for efficient data management.
