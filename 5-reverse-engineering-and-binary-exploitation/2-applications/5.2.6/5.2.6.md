# Explain and demonstrate buffer overflows

- Explain the concept of a stack based buffer overflow.

- What is the common vulnerability with the functions `strcpy`, `gets`, and `strcat`?

```text

```

- How you could leverage the vulnerability to gain control of the program's execution?

```text

```

- Compile `overflow.c`. What argument would you provide to overwrite `rbp` and `rip` so that they contain the following values:
  - `rbp`: `0x4242424242424242`
  - `rip`: `0x4343434343434343`

[Your program will actually segmentation fault before a garbage value for `rip` is loaded. If you provide the correct argument, `rbp` should be successfully overwritten, and the program should segfault at a `ret` instruction with the desired value for `rip` on the top of the stack.]

[You can provide an argument to a program running under `gdb` in 2 ways:
  - Run `gdb --args <your-program-name> <any arguments you'd like to pass>` from the command line. You can then start your program with `run` within `gdb`, and it will pass the arguments you provided.
  - Run `gdb <your-program-name>` from the command line, and then start your program with the `gdb` command `run <any args you'd like to pass`.]
