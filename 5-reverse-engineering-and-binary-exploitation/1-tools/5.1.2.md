# Explain the different segments of memory

```c
static int a = 10;
int b = 0;
static int c;
int d;

int main() {
   int size = 10;
   int e;
   char *f = "h4x0r";
   char *g = calloc(1, size);
   char h[] = "th3_c4t";
   return 0;
}
```

- In which memory segment would each of the variables' values reside?  What are their values?

| variable | value | segment | permissions |
|:--------:|:-------:|:-----:|:----------:|
| a |  |  |  |
| b |  |  |  |
| c |  |  |  |
| d |  |  |  |
| e |  |  |  |
| f |  |  |  |
| g |  |  |  |
| h |  |  |  |

- Explain, in terms of the location in memory, why the following lines are valid or invalid.

```c
f[0] = 'c';
h[4] = 'r';
```

```text
f:
h:
```
