# Demonstrate understanding of `send` and `recv`

Suppose a client and server have established a TCP connection using the
3-way handshake. Then the following occur in order:
- The client performs `send(sock, "hello!", 6, 0)`.
- The client performs `send(sock, "bye!", 4, 0)`.
- The server performs `recv(sock, buf1, 1024, 0)`.
- The server performs `recv(sock, buf2, 1024, 0)`.

Assume that `buf1` and `buf2` can hold 1024 bytes and were filled with 0s
before the call to `recv`.

Which of the following are technically possible contents of `buf1` and `buf2`
after the server's calls to `recv`?

| `buf1`          | `buf2`          |  possible?  |
|:-----------------------------------------------:|
| "hello!"        | "bye!"          |             |
| "bye!"          | "hello!"        |             |
| ""              | "hello!bye!"    |             |
| "hello!bye!"    | ""              |             |
| "hello!bye!"    | `recv` blocks   |             |
| "h"             | "ello!bye!"     |             |
| "hello!bye"     | "!"             |             |
| "h"             | "b"             |             |
| "he"            | "bye!"          |             |
| "he"            | "llo!bye!"      |             |
| "hb"            | "ye!"           |             |
| "he"            | "llb"           |             |
| "he"            | "ll"            |             |
| "heby"          | "e"             |             |
| "heby"          | "!"             |             |

Which of these is the most likely outcome for the server?

(Note: The answers would be basically the same with Python.)


One of the main take-aways from this section is that if you want to be able
to send and receive messages in reliable chunks (e.g., if you want to send
messages that will be executed as shell commands, the characters need to be
received in exactly the same groupings as they are sent) then you need to
do a fair bit of work beyond just calling `send` and `recv`.

The reference below (from the Python documentation) describes a few ways to
solve this issue. Describe in some detail how to implement the length-prefix
encoding scheme.
