# Explain and demonstrate `accept` and `connect`

- Explain what `accept` and `connect` do and how they are related.

    ```text
    accept (server):
    connect (client):
    ```

- Show in Wireshark the relationship between a server and a client.  Referencing stages of the TCP 3-way handshake, explain what happens when `accept` and `connect` are called by running the following in two terminals:

  - server

    ```bash
    $ nc -lp 31337
    ```

  - client

    ```bash
    $ nc localhost 31337
    ```

    ```text
    1.
    2.
    3.
    ```
