# Demonstrate packet filtering using Wireshark

- What filters you would use to display each of the following packets in Wireshark:

```text
---Packet 1---
    - source ip address = 192.168.1.321
    - protocol = tcp
    - destination port = 80

filter:
```

```text
---Packet 2---
    - destination ip address = 192.168.1.123
    - protocol = icmp
    - only display echo (ping) reply packets

filter:
```

```text
---Packet 3---
    - ip address (destination or source) = 192.168.1.123
    - protocol = tcp
    - source or destination port = 31337
    - data transmitted contains `hello`
        - note: packet could contain more than just hello
    - data length is less than 1048 bytes

filter:
```

## Examining packets

1. Use the `ip` command to get the following information about your machine (`man ip` for usage):

- mac address:
- ipv4  address:
- network interface:
- Note: if you have multiple network interfaces, chose the one that has the information requested

2. Open Wireshark

- Select the network interface from step 1
- Change interface: Capture --> Options
  - You must stop capturing packets to change the network interface
- Note: if you capture on all interfaces, your ethernet header may appear as a Linux cooked capture

3. Set a filter for:

- source mac address: <step1_mac_addrress>
- source ipv4 address: <step1_ipv4_address>
- tcp packets
- filter:

4. Select a TCP packet

- Right click Frame in packet information --> Copy the hexdump and paste it below

    ```text
    HEXDUMP:
    ```

5. Ethernet header

- What is the size of the ethernet header?
- Which bytes in the hexdump make up the ethernet header (paste them below)?

    ```text
    ETHERNET HEADER:
    ```

- What are the three elements of the ethernet header?

    1.
    2.
    3.

6. Examine the IPv4 header using [RFC 791](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc791) as reference

- What is the size of the IPv4 header?
- Which bytes in the hexdump make up the IPv4 header (paste them below)?

    ```text
    IPV4 HEADER:
    ```

- What are the twelve elements of the IPv4 header with no options field?

  1.
  2.
  3.
  4.
  5.
  6.
  7.
  8.
  9.
  10.
  11.
  12.

- Which bytes in the hexdump make up the source IP?
- If given the bytes `c0 a8 01 73` as the source IP, what would be actual IP address?

7. Examine the TCP header using [RFC 793](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793) as reference

- What is the size of the TCP header before the options?
- Which bytes in the hexdump make up the TCP header (paste them below)?

    ```text
    TCP HEADER:
    ```

- What are the twelve elements of the TCP header?

  1.
  2.
  3.
  4.
  5.
  6.
  7.
  8.
  9.
  10.
  11.
  12.

- Where does data go with regard to the TCP header?
- Which bytes in the hexdump make up the destination port?
- If given the bytes `22 b8` as the destination port, what would be actual port?
