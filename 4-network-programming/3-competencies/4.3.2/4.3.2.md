# Implement an echo server and client in C

JQR Addressed: Implement functionality of specific, predefined C functions to demonstrate basic concepts of a client and a server programming using C

Platform: Linux

Starter code: [Makefile](./Makefile), [lpp.h](./lpp.h), [lpp.c](./lpp.c), [client.c](./client.c), and [server.c](./server.c)

Requirements: `gcc` or `Visual Studio`

### Purpose

- This assignment will introduce you to the concept of network programming in C.

- By the end of this competency, you should have a basic understanding of:
  - basic networking functions
  - client-server communication
  - reallocating buffers

- Trainees will be expected to explain these concepts to the Training Lead or a qualified signer.

### Assignment

- Create two separate programs: a client and a server.
  - Using a configurable IPv4 address and port, create a connection between the client and server.
  - Client prompts the user for a message to send to the server.
  - Server sends the clientâ€™s message back to the client.
  - Repeat the process until either the client or server closes the connection.

- Troubleshoot using GDB

### Completion

- [ ] Valid function for user input: `fgets`, `getc`, `getchar`, `fgetc`, and `getline`

- [ ] Valid functions for socket communication: `send`, `sendto`, `recv`, and `recvfrom`

- [ ] Program runs like: `$ ./<client_or_server> <ipv4> <port>`

- [ ] Static library contains functions that the client and server have in common

- [ ] Makefile/Visual Studio compiles client program, server program, and static library

- [ ] Server-side: args should be IPv4 address and port server is bound to

- [ ] Client-side: args should be IPv4 address and port of server client is trying to connect to

- [ ] Program exits with an error message if IPv4 or port is invalid

- [ ] Server and client display message upon connection

- [ ] Client prompts user to input a message

- [ ] Buffer to store message is be dynamically allocated (size not predefined)

- [ ] Doesn't prompt user to input a max length (must resize buffer)

- [ ] Messages are sent all at once

- [ ] Correct message displayed on server side

- [ ] Echoes correct message to client

- [ ] Prints the number of bytes being sent and received

- [ ] Client prompts user to input another message after server echoes first message

- [ ] Server remains open, even if client closes the connection

- [ ] Client informs the user if the server is unreachable

- [ ] Client performs graceful shutdown if the server has closed
