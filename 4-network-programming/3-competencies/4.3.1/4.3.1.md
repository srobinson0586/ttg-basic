# Craft and send a raw TCP packet using the RFCs and Python struct

## Purpose

This competency will force you to get comfortable with the RFCs and some
of the important internet protocols. It should also familiarize you with
the Python `struct` module.

## Instructions

Follow the instructions in [`raw_packet.py`](./raw_packet.py).

You can use the ethernet Wikipedia page to learn about the ethernet frame
format.

RFCs 791 (IPv4) and 793 (TCP) will be very helpful (especially the diagrams
of the header formats and the detailed explanations that follow).

Use the Python `struct` module to turn integer values into raw bytes.
