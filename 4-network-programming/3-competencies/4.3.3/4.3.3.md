# Implement a robust echo client and server in Python

JQR Addressed: Implement functionality of specific, predefined Python functions to demonstrate basic concepts of a client and a server program using Python

Platform: Linux

Starter code: [client.py](./client.py), [server.py](./server.py), and [socketlib.py](./socketlib.py)


### Overview

- This assignment will introduce you to network programming in python.

- Write a simple echo server that creates a socket, accepts incoming connections
  1-by-1, and then echoes back each message the client sends it.

- Write a simple client that repeatedly asks the user for input, sends it to the
  server, and receives a response back.

- Just like in C, there is no guarantee in Python that a socket will send all
  the data you give it in the first call to `send` (and similarly for `recv`).
  You will need to implement a higher-level protocol over TCP to divide the
  stream into recognizable messages and send and receive them reliably.


### Requirements

- [ ] The server and client accept the IPv6 address and port number as
      command-line arguments.

- [ ] The programs print out helpful usage prompts when used incorrectly.

- [ ] The Programs correctly use a student-implemented protocol to ensure that
      messsages are fully sent and received.

- [ ] The server keeps a log file recording (with timestamps)
      - when the server starts,
      - when a client connects (and the client's address),
      - each message the client sends,
      - when a client closes the connection, and
      - when the server shuts down.

- [ ] Client and server shutdown gracefully when the user enters "exit".

- [ ] Client performs graceful exit if
      - it cannot connect to the server, or if
      - the server closes the connection unexpectedly.

- [ ] Server waits for another connection if the client disconnects unexpectedly.


### Additional exercises:

- Demonstrate and describe the usage of the following functions.

- sendto(): sends the byte object to the address specified in the function call
```python

```

- recvfrom(): receives bytes on the socket and returns the byte object as well as the address they're from
```python

```

- gethostname(): return a string containing the hostname of the machine the code is executing on
```python

```
