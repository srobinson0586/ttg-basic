# Complete a cumulative basic capstone project

## Prerequisites

1. Dual-boot your Windows machine with Ubuntu if you have not done so already (there are steps in the install guide)
  - Note: You will not get past Step 1 without dual-booting your machine

2. You will need access to the BasicCapstone server running at APS. Alternatively, reach out to TrainO to arrange a workaround.

## Step 1

1. Using python, craft a TCP packet to send to the server with the following information
  - dst mac: <server_mac>
  - src mac: <your_mac>
  - dst ip: <server_ipv4>
  - src ip: <your_ipv4>
  - dst port: 8888
  - src port: 9999
  - TTL: 0xaf
  - data: Hello
2. When the server receives a correctly formatted packet, it will send you a binary
	- Note: you must have a way to receive the binary that gets sent from the server

# Step 2:
1. RE the binary you receive (`elf_00`) to find the credentials necessary to ssh into the server

# Step 3:
1. Find the flag hidden in `secret.txt`

- final flag: __

# Bonus:
1. RE the binary you receive (`elf_01`) to print the flag
	- Note: you will have to run your exploit on the server in order to print the flag

- bonus flag: __
