# Dummy Payload
Let's just steal the hardwork of the cd00r team and use their code as a base library for our future shenanigans.

Take their main function and convert it into a function that your implant can nicely call whenever it needs to set up a backdoor. Ensure all the dynamic compilation options work. Create a new file for your sniffer library to keep your codebase organized.

Once you have this working, submit your commit.
