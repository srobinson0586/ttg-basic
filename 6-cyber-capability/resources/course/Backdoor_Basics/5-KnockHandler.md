# Knock Handler
Almost done with building the knock setup! Trust me, it's easier to architect the flexibility in at the beginning. Plus this is the fun part of coding, it just works and you're adding features.

Add the ability to your compilation script to define an arbitrary number of knock activation methods which each map to an arbitrary function. 

For example: 

1. Knock 1337 with magic bytes 1337, run Function 1
2. Knock 1337, 1338, 1339, run Function 2
3. Knock 13337 with magic bytes leet, run Function 3
