# Magic Knocks
There are infinite ways that we can activate our implant via portknocks, so let's add a second method and feel free to add more as you go. 

Give your implant the ability to call a function if it receives a port knock to a specific port with a magic string of bytes. Ensure to define which port knock method and what magic bytes at compilation time. Make sure to test this thoroughly so there aren't any bugs. 

The advanced version of magic knocks is known as Single Packet Authorization, or SPA. 

I highly recommend you steal code from this repository: [0xLAITH's SPA Backdoor](https://github.com/0xLAITH/SPA_Backdoor). Might be a bit of work to get going, but it will make your life easier.

As always, make sure that this information is being logged so that you are able to search for this implant's configuration and activation method in the future whenever you need to activate it.

1. What did you do to make that work? 
2. Submit the link to your git commit.
