# Add State
Modify your new implant to have "state". <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)>

Give your implant the ability to call a function if it receives port knocks to 2+ arbitrary ports (that were defined at compilation time) consecutively. Make sure to test this thoroughly so there aren't any bugs. 

As always, make sure that this information is being logged so that you are able to search for this implant's configuration and activation method in the future whenever you need to activate it.

1. What did you do to make that work? 
2. Submit the link to your git commit.
