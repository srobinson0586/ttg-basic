# Complexity
Alright that was a bit of a grind, but I hope you understand now the difference between architectures, static and dynamic linking, and stripped and unstripped binaries. 

It gets hairy pretty fast, especially as you add complexity to your program and the variety of target environments you are going after. There's no one answer, but there are more correct answers. 

There is a trade off between all of these things, but now that we've gotten sniffex working with this basic proof of concept, it should be easy for us to move forward as we add more complexity... right?
