# Counterpoint No
According to the grugq, one of the baddest dudes on the internet, no, you can't be an APT just because you built a custom tool. 

Read this, and believe every word of it. <https://medium.com/@thegrugq/cyber-ignore-the-penetration-testers-900e76a49500>

To sum it up "you can't download your way to parity with Fort Meade", as said by the incomparable [@Marasawr](https://twitter.com/marasawr). 

(Fun fact, Marasawr once judged a policy competition I was in. I got out of my depth technically, thinking I could get away with it in a policy setting, and they dismantled my position and mercifully allowed me to get back to more defensible ground. The other judges didn't know/realize what had happened.)

Respectfully Marasawr, you didn't specify what part of Fort Meade. Here at Hopper's Roppers, we're shooting for parity with a gas station Mexican place named Callejero's Tacos. Great stuff, couldn't recommend it more highly. 

Time to go be an APT. * Cue Rocky music and a slow motion montage *

If you want a good watch, here's some more Grugq on APT. It's an hour long version of the above paper, and focuses on the APT as a small part of the larger intelligence cycle. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP2J9aYM6Oo>
