You might be saying to yourself, wow this is very irresponsible, you are a bad person and probably breaking laws by teaching random people on the internet how to be an APT.

## tl;dr I have no knowledge of anything that qualifies me to write a course on becoming an APT... and yet here we are.  

This course teaches you how to replicate the functionality of an opensource malware named cd00r that has been floating around the internet since 2000. To put it mildly, I'm not breaking any new ground here. I did some reading and asked some experts who are not lawyers if this is an ITAR violation and the answer seems to be no (Let me know if you think it is).

More importantly than that, I have never had access to any classified information regarding computer security, and all information I know which is expressed in this course is derived from publicly available information. I did get a degree in "Cyber Operations", but that didn't teach anything beyond computing fundamentals and some vocab (Sorry guys, I'm sure the curriculum will improve eventually once you let me teach there). 

As always, opinions expressed on this site and training materials are solely my own and do not express the views or opinions of the DoD or any government organization.

Thanks for sticking around, hit me with any questions, comments, or concerns you might have at my email or on slack.
