# Memory Forensics
Do a quick check of what volatility sees when you run your process. 

Do it multiple times with different builds so that you can verify there isn't any easy signatures that can be written for your memory artifacts. 

Describe each memory artifact and if there are easy ways to minimize them. If there are any obvious signatures, add them to your to-do list to remove.  You don't want any of those, even though there aren't many Linux AVs out there.
