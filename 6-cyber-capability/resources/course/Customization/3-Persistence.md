# Persistence 
Now that you've figured out how to get the right privs, implement a function so that your implant can survive between reboots! The big boys are a fan of in-memory persistence these days, but we won't worry about that yet... besides, we're targeting Linux here. Nobody scans for malware anyway.

I won't tell you what to do here, but there are plenty of resources out there, here are some ideas:

Submit the link to the commit that allows your implant to survive between reboots.
