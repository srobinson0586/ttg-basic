# Download and Execute
Now it's time to build a classic dropper and actually have this baby do something!

Implement a function to download a file at a location set at compile time and execute it. Make sure that this works for both 32 and 64 bit Linux machines.

You can use 'wget' or the libcurl library, but think through your decision and the pros and cons of each.
