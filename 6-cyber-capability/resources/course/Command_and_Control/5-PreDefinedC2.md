# PreDefined C2
Okay, C2 channel is up and running. Let's modify your code so that you can define your implant's behavior at time of generation.

1. Add an option to set the sleep time between callbacks
2. Add an option to set a jitter time between sleeps 
3. Add an option to have implant call back instantly when executed
4. Add the option to have implant sleep a set amount of time after execution
5. Add the ability to only trigger C2 after portknocking has occurred
6. Add the ability to begin C2 to the IP address ( and resolve the domain if available) that the portknock occurred from
