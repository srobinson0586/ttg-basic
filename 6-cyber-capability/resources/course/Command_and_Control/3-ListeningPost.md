# Listening Post
You have the existing code for the listening post, now we are going to add onto it to keep track of who is responding to us, as well as add logging functionality.

* Conduct registrations on initial call backs, build connection directories
* If a request is properly authenticated, respond with tasks from the file provided in the connection directories
* If callback contains data, save it to output logs
* Continue listening for requests
* Log everything
