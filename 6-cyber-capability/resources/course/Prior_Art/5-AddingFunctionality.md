# Adding Functionality
Time to add our own unique functionality to cd00r. 

Or more accurately, we are just going to rip out the port knocking functionality from cd00r, put it in a new file, and then call it from our existing implant. Ensure everything works!

1. Explain your modifications to the original cd00r code.
2. Submit the C source of the code. 

- Run srings, ldd, readelf, strace on the file

3. What do you find? What was the difference?

Alright sure, we shouldn't be submitting our malware to VirusTotal or we burn ourselves. In a perfect world we have a nice, reputable nodistribute/noforward to send our stuff to, or we have built our own, but we're a budget APT right now.

For this assignment, submit the answers to your questions.
