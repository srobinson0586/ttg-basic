# Reverse Shell
Very similar to the bind shell you did before, [implement a reverse shell in C](https://rastating.github.io/creating-a-reverse-tcp-shellcode/) and modify your implant generation and logging scripts so that you can generate an implant which calls back to a compile-time designated IP and Port every n seconds, with n also designated at compile time.

Ensure that once a connection is made, the implant does not continue to open reverse shells.
