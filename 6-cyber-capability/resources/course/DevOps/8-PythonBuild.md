# Python Build
Oh man, I am about to piss people off...make does not allow us the flexibility we need to compile the range of variables we are going to be playing with. 

Using the same  general methods in the makefile, create a python script that takes in arguments and generates your C backdoors. Save this script (or scripts) in /src/buildScripts.

Ensure:

1. Script uses argparse or another equivalent library
2. Script creates logs of what commands are given, when, and results
3. Everything you've done so far still works!
4. You still have a debugging option and a valgrind option

Add as much complexity as you want, you'll continually add features to this. **Do not worry about reverse compatibility, please. It will just be unnecessary work for now.**
