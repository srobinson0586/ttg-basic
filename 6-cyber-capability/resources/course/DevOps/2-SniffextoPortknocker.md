# Sniffex to Portknocker
Using the sniffex.c file, implement a portknocking mechanism that checks for a single knock to a pre-defined port and then calls a function which prints BANG.

Use netcat in the same way you did with cd00r to test your modified sniffex.

1. What did you have to do to get that to work?

2. What do you see? Experiment to see how it works. 

We now have one attack function and one activation method, but that does not an APT make. There are so many more functions and activation methods we will write as we go through the course.

For the assignment, submit a link to your commit.
