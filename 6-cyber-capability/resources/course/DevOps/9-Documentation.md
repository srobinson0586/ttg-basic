# Documentation
Don't worry too much about documenting everything your tool does right now, but start at least by writing up a setup and installation guide and a brief bit on how your build process works. Keep this documentation generally updated as you go because you are an adult and should do that.

At a minimum provide:

* Commands required to install
* Dependencies
* Examples of how to use scripts
* A description of all files 
* Any known bugs

Save this in /resources/docs and submit your commit.
