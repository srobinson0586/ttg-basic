# Git
You've already cloned our repo, make sure you are committing and pushing often. 

I am a huge fan of this Git Best Practices document: 

<https://gist.github.com/pandeiro/1552496>

Highlights are:

* Commit early and often
    * Nobody is judging you for your code here
* Don't Panic
* Dividing work into repositories
   * Break individual modules into their own directories to provide logical separation
* Choose a Workflow
   * Say it with me, "in this APT, we don't commit to master". We use a dev branch and a master branch in addition to locals, and we push and pull like adults. 
* Have Releases
   * When we have made major updates to the code, we have a full release. It's the right thing to do. 
* Write useful commit messages
   * You know this, I know this, but we don't do it. Write useful things in your messages.
* Have a meaningful git ignore file
   * Please, don't commit secrets, and no, you can't just commit over them. With a good ignore file we can avoid those problems. 

I'll be helping you do this along the way, just try to use best practices.

For this assignment, make a git ignore file to make sure you don't commit your binaries like a complete buffoon.
