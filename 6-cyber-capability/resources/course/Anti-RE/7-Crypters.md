# Crypters
This is in-process, looking for good resources and activities.

Read this article: <https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2015/12/malware-crypters-the-deceptive-first-layer/>

Building off of [Armoring the ELF](https://grugq.github.io/docs/phrack-58-05.txt) you are going to write your own slightly modified crypter. I'm not asking you to be totally unique in your implementation, so copy away, just make sure that it's different enough that someone will have to RE you a bit.

These are two good resources:

* <https://www.guitmz.com/linux-elf-runtime-crypter/>
* <https://0x00sec.org/t/a-simple-linux-crypter/537>

Once you've had your fun making that, get this working <https://github.com/elfmaster/davinci/blob/master/README>. It is excellent. 

Do a brief writeup on what you needed to do to get davinci working and save it in resources/misc.

Submit your commit.
