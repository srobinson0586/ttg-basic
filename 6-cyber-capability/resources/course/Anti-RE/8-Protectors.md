# Protectors
This is in-process, looking for good resources and activities.

A third approach is a protector, which uses packing/encrypting/ and even more insanity to make something really really painful to RE. Some of them involve rewriting assembly to a new language and then executing that on a virtual kernel... yeah.

Protectors are banana land and we won't write our own, but I do want you to get this working on 32 bit versions of your implant <https://github.com/xiaoweime/WProtect>

Do a writeup on what you did to make this work and save it in resources/misc. 

Submit your commit.
