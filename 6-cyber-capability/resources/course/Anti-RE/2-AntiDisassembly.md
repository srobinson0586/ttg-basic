# AntiDisassembly
Break the Dissasembler!

Attack their assumptions. Your implementations should target specific dissassemblers.

Notable ways to do this:

* Junk Data
* Opaque Predicates 
* Pointer Manipulation
* Random Jumps (especially backward) 
* Manipulating SEH

Implement one and describe how it works. Very it breaks your targeted dissasembler.
