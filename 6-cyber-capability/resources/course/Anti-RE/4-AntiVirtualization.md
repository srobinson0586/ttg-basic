# AntiVirtualization
Break their sandbox, and make it harder for their analysts to look at it!

Implement a method of detecting a VM and describe how it works. Verify it breaks your targeted VM. 

Understand that when you do this, it is still very easy to patch out and they will be able to manually run it.
