# Resources

`course` contains all the material, check out README.md for a prettified version.

`commentedCode/` will contain all the code you comment throughout this course.

`docs/` will contains all the documentation your write for your implant.

`misc/` will be used to save anything else you (or I) feel is nessecary to save locally.

> This directory is largely untouched from the original repo, so you will see a lot more discrepancies. You will encounter iffy resources IRL, work through it.
