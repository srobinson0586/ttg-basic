# Cyber Capability Capstone

## Overview

The JQR requires all Basic Cyberspace Capability Developers be able to create their own "Cyber Capability". This module addresses that JQS Line item. Because of the broad scope of the requirement, which is done on purpose, this module will be very much a more on-your-own (and more fun) effort.

This module will follow the basic structure of the **amazing** Roppers Academy course available on GitHub at [dennisdevey/linuxImplantFundamentals](https://github.com/dennisdevey/linuxImplantFundamentals/tree/main/). It's a relatively work-in-progress course, but the provided outline is more than enough to get you to where you need to be.

Throughout this module you will see material copied and modified (with the author's permission) from that repository to make it something you can complete in a reasonable amount of time. Once you're done with this version of it, you're free to go clone the course and work through the entire thing on your own time (it's very fun)!

## Objectives

**This is not a quick and easy module you simply cross off in a couple of days**. It is the culmination of what you have learned throughout the entire JQR. Expect to spend considerable time and effort on this. Once complete, you will be able to say that you've written your very own, *custom* Linux Implant.

The goal is to simulate the process of a client giving you requirements for a desired capability, and you pumping out a decent and usable product. Mentors will be available for questions, but won't be holding your hand through this. You need to prove you are capable of being an independent and competent member of a capability development team.
