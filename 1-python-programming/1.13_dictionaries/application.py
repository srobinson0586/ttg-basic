# TODO 1: Merge Dictionaries
# Implement a function that takes two dictionaries as input and merges them into a single dictionary.
# If there are any common keys, the value from the second dictionary should overwrite the value from the first dictionary.
def merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):
    pass

# TODO 2: Filter Dictionary
# Implement a function that takes a dictionary and a list of keys as input.
# The function should return a new dictionary that only contains the key-value pairs from the original dictionary
# whose keys are present in the given list.
def filter_dictionary(dictionary, keys):
    pass

# TODO 3: Count Values
# Implement a function that takes a dictionary as input and returns a new dictionary
# where the keys are the unique values from the original dictionary and the values are the count of occurrences of each value.
def count_values(dictionary):
    pass

# TODO 4: Remove Keys
# Implement a function that takes a dictionary and a *list* 'keys' as input.
# The function should remove the key-value pairs from the dictionary for the keys present in the given list.
def remove_keys(dictionary, keys):
