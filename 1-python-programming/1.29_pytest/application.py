# Python Pytest - Application
 
# CREATE YOUR OWN APPLICATION AND TEST FILE
# Be creative with your application!
# It should cause some errors that you can then test in test_application.py.

# Your application must raise the following types of Exceptions:
# - TypeError
# - ValueError
# - A custom NCWDGError
#     - See 1.28_exceptions module for help with custom Exceptions
# - FileNotFoundError
# - NameError

# These are some of the most common exceptions you will see, hence why they were chosen.
# Each of the above errors must be raised in individual functions
#     e.g.: a my_TE() func for TypeError, my_NE() func fo NameError

# TODO: Implement error functions below
