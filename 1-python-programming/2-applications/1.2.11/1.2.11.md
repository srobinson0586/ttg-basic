# Demonstrate the behavior of mutable and immutable objects in Python

Code: [fixme.py](./fixme.py)

- Comment out any errors in ```fixme.py``` and show that it prints ```code fixed!```

- Explain each of the errors (in the Python file, on the same line).

- Was the print statement what you expected? Discuss any errors you expected but
  didn't actually happen. In particular, explain why line 27 behaves the way it
  does.
