# Python Strings - Application

# 1. TODO: Create two strings 'str1' and 'str2'. Set the value of 'str1' to 'foo' and the value of 'str2' to 'bar'.
# 2. TODO: Concatenate 'str1' and 'str2' to create 'foobar'. Assign this to 'str3'.
# 3. TODO: Iterate through the string 'sentence' and count the number of vowels in it. Store the total number of vowels in a variable called 'vowel_count'.
sentence = "I want a sandwich because I am hungry."
# 4. TODO: For 'sentence', replace the word 'sandwich' with 'hamburger' and assign the resulting string to 'food'
# 5. TODO: Transform all lowercase characters in 'sentence' to uppercase and save this string in 'all_caps'
# 6. TODO: Create three variables called 'make', 'model', and 'year' and assign them values based on the kind of car you drive. Use an f-string to print a basic sentence using these variables.
