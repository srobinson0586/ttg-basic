# Implement functionality of specific, predefined Python functions to demonstrate knowledge of control flow, variables, calling functions, and utilizing pydocs

Code: [intro.py](./intro.py) and [verifier.py](./verifier.py)

### Purpose

- This assignment will introduce you to programming in python3.
- By the end of this competency, you should have a basic understanding of:
  - control flow
  - variables
  - calling functions
  - utilizing pydocs
- Trainees will be expected to explain these concepts to the Training Lead or a qualified signer.
- This assignment is the basic building block for future competencies.

### Assignment

- Complete the exercises in [intro.py](./intro.py).
- If you get stuck, you can look at the code in [examples.py](./examples.py) to get some exposure to basic data types, program control, loop types, and boolean operations.
- Test your work using [verifier.py](./verifier.py) by running `python3 verifier.py`.
