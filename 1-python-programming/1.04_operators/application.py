# Python Operators - Application

# Starting in this module, the `application.py` files will usually give you skeleton code for functions and task you with returning a desired value.
# Functions will be covered in much more detail in `1.15_functions`. You may read ahead if you'd like but its a slightly more advanced topic, hence why its covered later.
# For now, you can watch this video if you have no idea what a function is and want to get this application running: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bkupx9gX0o&list=PL98qAXLA6afuh50qD2MdAj3ofYjZR_Phn&t=1s
# TLDR;
#     - Functions let you reuse code
#     - They take 'parameters', in `multiply_and_divide` below, they are a,b,c
#     - They return a value with the `return` statement

# For the tasks below, write your code where the `pass` word is and return a value with the statement `return <value_you_want>`

def multiply_and_divide(a, b, c):
    """
    Calculates the result of multiplying a by b, then dividing the result by c

    Args:
        a (float or int): The first operand.
        b (float or int): The second operand.
        c (float or int): The divisor.

    Returns:
        float: The result of multiplying a by b, then dividing the result by c

def concatenate_strings(str1, str2):
    """
    Concatenates two strings based on certain conditions.

    If the lengths of the two strings are equal, it returns "SameLength".
    If str1 is an empty string, it returns str2.
    If str2 is an empty string, it returns str1.
    Otherwise, it concatenates str1 and str2 and returns the result.

    Args:
        str1 (str): The first string.
        str2 (str): The second string.

    Returns:
        str: The concatenated string or "SameLength" based on conditions.
