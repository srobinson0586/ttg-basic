# Python Conditionals - Application

# Challenge 1
def nested_conditionals(x):
    """
    Write a function called nested_conditionals that takes an integer input x.
    The function should perform the following checks:
    - If x is greater than 1337 and less than or equal to 4444, return "Between 1338 and 4444".
    - If x is greater than 4444, print "Above 4444".
    - If x is less than or equal to 1337, print "1337 or below".

    Return:
        A string depending on the input.
    """
    pass


# Challenge 2
def max_number(a, b, c):
    """
    Write a function called max_number that takes three integer inputs, a, b, and c.
    The function should use ONLY THE PYTHON TERNARY OPERATOR (Short hand if ... else)
    You may use an intermediary temp variable to store the results of ternary operations to chain multiple of them together

    Return:
        The greatest integer in the input

    Example:
    max_number(10, 15, 5)   # Return: 15
    max_number(100, 50, 75) # Return: 100
