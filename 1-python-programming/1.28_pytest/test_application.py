# Python Pytest - Pytest Suite
 
# CREATE YOUR OWN APPLICATION AND TEST FILE
# In this file you must test for each of the required Exceptions in application.py 
# It will likely need to be a try / except implementation where you assert that 
#    each returned Exception is of the expected type

# Make at least two tests fail, so you get some pytest failure output

# Example:
#    try:
#        my_app.my_TE()
#    except Exception as te:
#        assert type(te) == TypeError

# TODO: Implement tests below
