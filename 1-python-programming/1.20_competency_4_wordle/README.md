# Python Competency 4 - Wordle

[Back to OVERVIEW](../README.md)

Code: [`wordle.py`](./wordle.py)

## Objectives

In this competency you will apply your accumulated Python skills by completing a relatively complex project.

## What is Wordle?
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle):
> "Wordle is a web-based word game created and developed by Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle. Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position... Wordle has a single daily solution, with all players attempting to guess the same word."
Play it [here](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)!

## Wordle Implementation Description

There are docstrings in each of the methods that you are required to implement which provide more detail on what is required.

## Assignment
- [ ] Complete the functions outlined in [`wordle.py`](./wordle.py)
    -  The `evaluate_guess()` function is the most difficult part of this exercise. To help you test it, we've provided a special function, `test_evaluate()`; call it instead of `play` if you want to test your `evaluate_guess` function.
- [ ] When you're done, you should be able to play Wordle with Python in the terminal by running `python3 wordle.py`
