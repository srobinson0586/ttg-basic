# Python Competency 4 Wordle

[Back to OVERVIEW](../README.md)

## Purpose

In this assignment you will apply your accumulated Python skills by completing a relatively complex project.

## Assignment

Complete the functions outlined in `wordle.py`.
The `evaluate_guess()` function is the most difficult part of this exercise. To help you test it, we've provided a special function, `test_evaluate()`; call it instead of play if you want to test your evaluate_guess function.
When you're done, you should be able to play Wordle with Python in the terminal by running 
```bash
python3 wordle.py
```
