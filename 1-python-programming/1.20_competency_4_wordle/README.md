# Python Competency 4 - Wordle

[Back to OVERVIEW](../README.md)

Code: [`wordle.py`](./wordle.py)

## Objectives

In this competency you will apply your accumulated Python skills by completing a relatively complex project.

## Wordle Implementation Description

There are docstrings in each of the methods that you are required to implement which provide more detail on what is required.

## Assignment
- [ ] Complete the functions outlined in [`wordle.py`](./wordle.py)
    -  The `evaluate_guess()` function is the most difficult part of this exercise. To help you test it, we've provided a special function, `test_evaluate()`; call it instead of `play` if you want to test your `evaluate_guess` function.
- [ ] When you're done, you should be able to play Wordle with Python in the terminal by running `python3 wordle.py`
