# Implement sorting algorithms in Python

Code: [sorting.py](./sorting.py)

# Purpose

- This assignment will help you practice understanding an algorithm and then implementing it in Python.

# Assignment

- Implement each of the sorting algorithms in sorting.py.
- Use Wikipedia as a reference on how each algorithm works.
- As you go, test each function on simple and complicated lists using the test() function.
