# Python Recursion
Recursion is a powerful concept in computer science and programming where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It's often used for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller instances of the same problem.

This is an expansion upon what is originally taught in [1.21 Algorithms](../1.21_algorithms/algorithms.md). 

Here's a high-level explanation of how recursion works:

1. **Base Case:** Every recursive function needs a base case. This is the simplest form of the problem that can be solved directly. Without a base case, the recursion would continue indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow error.

2. **Recursive Step:** In the recursive step, the function calls itself with a modified version of the problem. The idea is to reduce the problem size with each recursive call until it reaches the base case.

3. **Combining Results:** As the recursion "unwinds" (i.e., the function calls start returning), the results from the smaller instances of the problem are combined to solve the original problem.

Here's a pseudo-code explanation of recursion using the example of calculating the factorial of a number:

```
function factorial(n):
    if n equals 0:
        return 1  // Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
    else:
        return n times factorial(n - 1)
        // Recursive step: Reduce the problem by one and multiply by n

result = factorial(5)
print result  // Output: 120
```

In this pseudo-code, the `factorial` function takes an integer `n` as input and calculates its factorial. The base case is when `n` becomes 0, and in this case, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it performs the recursive step by calling itself with `n - 1` and then multiplying the result by `n`.

The process continues recursively until the base case is reached, at which point the recursion starts to unwind, and the results are combined to obtain the final result. This structure is a fundamental characteristic of recursive algorithms.

Here is the same problem solved in Python:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

result = factorial(5)
print(result)  # Output: 120
```

In the base case when the number passed to factorial is 0, the python program returns 1 and does not continue to call deeper into the growing recursive stack. At this point, just like in the pseudo-code example, the program will start to unwind and combine the stack's results. 

## Risks of Recursion

Recursion can be a powerful technique in programming, but it also comes with some potential dangers and drawbacks, especially in Python. Here are a few key concerns to be aware of when using recursion:

1. **Stack Overflow:** One of the most significant dangers of recursion is the possibility of causing a stack overflow. Each recursive function call adds a new frame to the call stack. If the recursion doesn't have a proper base case or the problem size doesn't decrease with each recursive call, the call stack can grow to a point where it exceeds its capacity, resulting in a stack overflow error. This can crash your program.

2. **Memory Usage:** Recursive solutions can consume a significant amount of memory due to the accumulation of function call frames on the stack. Each function call requires memory to store local variables, parameters, and the return address. In cases of deep recursion or when dealing with large data structures, this can lead to excessive memory usage.

3. **Performance:** Recursive solutions might not be the most efficient choice for some problems. Function calls in Python have overhead, and the recursive approach might involve redundant calculations due to repeated function calls with similar arguments. This can result in slower execution compared to iterative solutions or other algorithms tailored to the specific problem.

4. **Debugging Complexity:** Debugging recursive code can be challenging. As the function calls build up on the stack, it can be difficult to trace the flow of execution and identify the source of an error. This can make troubleshooting and fixing issues more time-consuming.

5. **Readability and Maintainability:** Excessive use of recursion can lead to code that's difficult to read and understand, especially for those not familiar with the specific recursive approach. Iterative solutions or other algorithmic techniques might offer clearer code that's easier to maintain.

To mitigate these dangers, it's important to follow best practices when using recursion:

- Always define a proper base case that will halt the recursion.
- Ensure that the problem size decreases with each recursive call.
- Consider using tail recursion when possible. In tail recursion, the recursive call is the last operation in the function, which allows some programming languages (not Python) to optimize memory usage.
- Test your recursive code thoroughly and be mindful of potential performance issues.
- If you're concerned about stack overflow, you can use techniques like memoization or dynamic programming to optimize recursive solutions and reduce unnecessary recomputation.

Keep in mind that while recursion is a powerful tool, it's not always the most efficient solution for every problem. In some cases, iterative solutions might be more suitable. It's always a good practice to analyze the problem and choose the appropriate approach based on its characteristics and constraints.
