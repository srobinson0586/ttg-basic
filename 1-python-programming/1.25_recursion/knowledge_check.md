# Python Recursion - Knowledge Check
Sure, here's a 10-question test about recursion with a mix of multiple choice, short answer, and true/false questions:

**Recursion Test**

**Multiple Choice:**

1. What is recursion in programming?

   a) A loop construct

   b) A way to solve problems by breaking them into smaller instances of the same problem

   c) A method to define data structures

   d) A type of data manipulation

2. Which of the following is a required component for a recursive function?
   a) Dynamic programming

   b) Stack overflow

   c) Base case

   d) Iteration

**True/False:**

3. True or False: A base case in a recursive function is not necessary.
   
4. True or False: Every recursive function must have a recursive step.

5. True or False: Recursion is always more efficient than iteration.

**Short Answer:**

6. Explain the concept of a base case in recursion and why it is important.

7. Write a short recursive function in Python to calculate the sum of the first `n` positive integers.

8. Describe a situation where using recursion might be more suitable than using iteration.

**Multiple Choice:**

9. What is a potential drawback of using excessive recursion in programming?

   a) Faster execution

   b) Lower memory usage

   c) Difficult debugging

   d) Improved readability

10. When does a recursive function become inefficient?

    a) When it doesn't have a base case

    b) When it uses dynamic programming

    c) When it has too many iterations

    d) When the same subproblems are solved multiple times
