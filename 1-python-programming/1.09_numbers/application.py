# 1. TODO: Declare a variable called 'radius' and set its value to an integer between 1 and 10.
#          Then, declare a variable called 'circumference` and set its value as (2 * pi * radius).
# 2. TODO: Declare a variable called 'area' and set its value to (pi * radius^2).
#          NOTE: The '^' operator in python does NOT mean to exponentiate a value! Use a function
#                from the 'math' module to create an exponent expression, or the '**' operator.
# 3. TODO: Create a list called 'scores' with 5 floating point values between 0.0 and 100.0.
#          Next, declare a variable called `best_score` and set it equal to the highest
#          value in the list. Find this value using Python's built-in max() function.
# 4. TODO: Declare and assign a value to a floating point variable 'not_rounded'. Declare and set
#          a variable 'rounded' using the round() function.
