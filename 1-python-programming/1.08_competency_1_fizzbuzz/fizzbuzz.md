# Python - FizzBuzz

For this competency, you will be writing in the code needed for the FizzBuzz program. 

FizzBuzz is a program that prints numbers from 1 to a given limit, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz," multiples of 5 with "Buzz," and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz."

You will make use of a variable called `limit` that is already created for you. This variable determines how many numbers will be printed. You should use a loop to iterate from 1 to the given `limit`.

For each number, the program should check if it's a multiple of both 3 and 5. If so, you should print "FizzBuzz."

If the number is only a multiple of 3, you should print "Fizz". Similarly, if the number is only a multiple of 5, you should print "Buzz".

If none of the above conditions are met, the program should simply print the number itself.

As an example, a correct implementation fizzbuzz with the `limit=20` would be:

```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
17
Fizz
19
Buzz
```

## Requirements

- [ ] Use of a loop to iterate through the number range
- [ ] Use of conditional statements and operators
- [ ] Use of appropriate arithmetic operator(s)
- [ ] The program correctly prints out "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", or the current number in the loop iteration
