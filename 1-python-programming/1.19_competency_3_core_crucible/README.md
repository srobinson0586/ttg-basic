# Python Competency 3 - Core Crucible

[Back to OVERVIEW](../README.md)

Code: [`core.py`](./core.py)

## Objectives

- This assignment will test your familiarity with all the concepts that have been covered up until this point.
- By the end of this competency, you will have proven a basic understanding of:
  - control flow
  - variables
  - calling functions
  - utilizing Pydocs
  - file operations
  - returning multiple values
  - recursion
- Trainees will be expected to explain these concepts to the Training Lead or a qualified signer.

## Assignment

- [ ] Complete the exercises in [`core.py`](./core.py)
  - The functions are generally split up into *Introduction functions*, *File IO functions*, and *Generic functions* in that order.
  - There are docstrings in each of the functions that you are required to implement which provide more detail on what is required.
  - If you get stuck, you can look at the code in [`examples.py`](./examples.py) to get some exposure to basic data types, program control, loop types, and boolean operations.
- [ ] Test your work using [`verifier.py`](./verifier.py) by running `python3 verifier.py`
  - If you are having trouble or are curious about how the testing works,[`verifier.py`](./verifier.py) uses the test suite in [`test.py`](./test.py).
