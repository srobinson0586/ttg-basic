# Pointer Practice
Write a program in C to show the basic declaration of a pointer.

## Expected Output:

 Here is m=10, n and o are two integer variable and *z is an integer                                          
                                                                                                              
 z stores the address of m  = 0x7ffd40630d44                                                                  
                                                                                                              
 *z stores the value of m = 10                                                                                
                                                                                                              
 &m is the address of m = 0x7ffd40630d44                                                                      
                                                                                                              
 &n stores the address of n = 0x7ffd40630d48                                                                  
                                                                                                              
 &o  stores the address of o = 0x7ffd40630d4c                                                                 
                                                                                                              
 &z stores the address of z = 0x7ffd40630d50
