# Harvard's CS50 Course for New Programmers

For the first month, we will be doing the first 6 weeks of Harvard's CS50 course. The purpose is to build a great base that will get us to complete the TTG-B at a much faster pace, but also more confidently.

# Information Before Starting

Please follow the order below for each week:

**Lecture -> Section -> Problem Set**

The only problem set that is *not* required to be completed is Scratch.

These problem sets are meant to be tough and take several hours. However, struggle is how you improve. Take your time, reach out for help and don't feel afraid to search anything up!


**After finishing each problem set, please send them to the Training Team for review.**


Once you are done, you can *officially* start the TTG-B.
