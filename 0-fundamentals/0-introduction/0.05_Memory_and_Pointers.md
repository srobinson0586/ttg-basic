## Computer Memory

The way computers store and access elements of a program is through something called memory management.

The computer has a large store of memory, called the heap. Imagine this as a storage facility. You can rent one or more storage lockers (think of these like the _segments of memory_) and fill with as many items as you can fit. 

For this example, you reserve a storage locker of 10' by 10' by 10' or 1000 cubic feet of storage space.

You will learn more about "renting" these storage structures later. For now, focus on these main takeaways:
- Memory is a way to store objects in the form of bytes for your program
- Memory segments on the heap come in the form of "storage lockers" where only you own the key to that specific locker.
- You can only fit as many items as your storage locker will allow. If you need to store anything more, get another locker!

## Pointer fundamentals

Our previous analogy introduced memory storage like a storage locker. To properly access the storage locker, you need a _key_. In computer memory access, your key is called a _pointer_. Just like a key contains the address of one storage locker, a pointer to a chunk of allocated memory contains the address of the start of that memory chunk. You need that pointer to access the memory, just like you need the key to access the storage locker.

If you lost the key, you would most likely have a very hard time getting the items in your locker. 

If you lost your pointer, or overwrote it, or deleted it, you would have a very difficult time getting to the items stored at that memory address.

> Bottom line: Pointers are like a key in that they allow you to access a "storage locker" of memory within a program. It does not contain the value itself, just how to get to the location in memory which holds the items you are looking for.
