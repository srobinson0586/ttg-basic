# _Open Source Information for Programming_

All programmers rely on open-source information to complete their projects.

To search sources for relevant information, frequently _Google.com_, you need to be efficient at it.

## Keyword Searching

We are looking to solve a problem within our user defined function, _myFunction_, and we want to use open-source information to help us.

```_myFunction_ takes two values, A and B, and returns the product minus 21. ```

Our Current roadblock is this:
- We know how to multiply values
- We know how to subtract values
- We do **not** know how precedence works within this language.

To ensure that we get the most applicable information in our open-source search, utilize the Quotation Marks ("") around your keyword. 
In this case, we would encapsulate "precedence" in our google search. This will ensure that all results returned from the search engine contain the word "precedence".

Example:
```"precedence" arithmetic operation c```

_This is one way to minimize under-specificity when searching._

## Site searching

You know the topic you need to search, but want to refine your search to just one website.

To utilize a search like this use **site:** operator.

```site:stackoverflow.com "precedence" c arithmetic```

This will only return open-source information from StackOverflow.com which contains the word precedence
