2. According to clean code guidelines, what should you avoid in if conditionals?
   - A) Relying on negation of boolean values
   - B) Using descriptive variable names
   - C) Making conditionals too complex
   - D) Using comments to explain conditionals
   ```
   ANSWER:
   ```
   
3. What is the purpose of using explanatory variables in code?
   - A) To confuse other developers
   - B) To save memory space
   - C) To explain the purpose of variables

   ```
   ANSWER: 
   ```
   
5. Why is it recommended to use searchable names for variables?
   - A) To make the code shorter
   - B) To improve code performance
   - C) To allow easy searching within the program

7. What should a function ideally do, according to the "Do One Thing" principle?
   - A) Perform multiple unrelated tasks
   - B) Have unpredictable return values
   - C) Have one predictable return value from one distinct function
   - D) Include as many arguments as possible
   ```
   ANSWER: 
   ```
   
8. Why is it recommended to prefer fewer arguments in a function?
   - A) It reduces the need for function calls
   - B) It makes code harder to understand
   - C) It improves code modularity
   - D) It increases the complexity of the function
   ```
   ANSWER: 
   ```
   
9. What does it mean to have "No Side Effects" in a function?
   - A) The function doesn't produce any output
   - B) The function doesn't modify the overall program
   - C) The function has multiple return values
   - D) The function has a single argument
   ```
   ANSWER: 
   ```
   
10. According to clean code guidelines, when should you use comments in your code?
   - A) Always, to explain every line of code
   - B) Only when the code is simple
   - C) Only when the code is complex
   - D) When the code cannot communicate its intent
   ```
   ANSWER: 
   ```
   
### Memory and Pointers (Multiple Choice)

11. What is the primary purpose of computer memory in a program?

   ```
   ANSWER:
   ``` 
   
12. In the context of memory and pointers, what does a pointer represent?
   - A) The actual data value
   - B) The address of a memory location
   - C) The size of the storage locker
   - D) The number of bytes allocated
   ```
   ANSWER:
   ``` 
   
13. What happens if you lose or overwrite a pointer in a program?
   - A) It has no impact on memory access
   - B) It makes memory access more efficient
   - C) It can make it difficult to access data at that memory location
   - D) It improves program performance
   ```
   ANSWER:
   ```
