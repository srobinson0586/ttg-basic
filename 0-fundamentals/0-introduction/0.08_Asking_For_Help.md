# Collaboration and Help

[Back to README](README.md)

Your coworkers are invaluable resources to your success here, just as you are to them. 

_Inevitably, you will need help on your project._

When you do, please do not be afraid to ask for help. 
Any one of the qualified developers will be willing to help when they have the time.

## Things to consider before seeking help

While seeking help is actively encouraged, check the following first:
- Is the information I am looking for theoretical or concrete?
    - If concrete, have you checked any available Open Sources for it? Man pages?
    - If theoretical, is there any procedure you could follow to come to a solution yourself?
- Is the information expected knowledge from a previous JQR module?
    - If so, check with your already completed modules for a hint.
- Is the point of the exercise to be independent research?
    - If so, keep digging before seeking help. Some concepts are intentionally difficult to find information on.

## Got Nothing, Need Help.

If your Open Source searches came back with nothing, seek help from someone with a better understanding! It's what we are here for.

_Once you finished your module, find out why the information was difficult to find. If it is a systemic issue, or have found yourself struggling to grasp a similar topic multiple times, take some time with a qualified developer to fix any deficiencies._
