# Git Workflow

[Back to README](README.md)

This section will discuss the importance and uses of `git`.

## Why Is Git Important?
Before we dive into the Git workflow, let's understand why Git is essential for anyone working with code:
- **Version Control:** Git allows you to keep track of changes in your code over time. This means you can view, compare, and even revert to earlier versions of your project, preventing potential disasters when you make a mistake.
- **Collaboration:** If you're working with a team, Git makes it easy to collaborate. Multiple people can work on the same project without stepping on each other's toes. Git handles merging and resolving conflicts seamlessly.
- **Backup and Security:** With Git, your code is stored on your local machine and remotely (e.g., on GitHub). This redundancy provides an excellent backup system, ensuring that your work is safe even if your local machine crashes.
- **Experimentation:** Git allows you to create branches for experimenting with new features without affecting the main project. You can test your ideas independently and then merge them when they're ready.

## Basic Git Workflow
Now, let's delve into what your workflow will be like with the TTG-B.  In order to request signatures and make changes to your Github repository, you'll generally follow this workflow:
1. Add Files: Before you can commit your changes, you need to tell Git which files to track. You can add individual files or add them all using:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

2. Commit Changes: After adding the files, commit your changes with a descriptive message:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Your commit message here"
    ```
    Commit messages help you and others understand what changes were made.  Generally, commit messages should be in the present tense (e.g. "Complete section 1.23") as if you are ordering the codebase to change.

    > **Note:** You can combine steps 1 & 2 into one with the command:
    ```bash
    git commit -am "Your commit message here"
    ```


3. Push to GitHub: Now, you'll want to upload your project to GitHub, a popular platform for hosting Git repositories. You can push your code using:
    ```bash
    git push
    ```
    This command sends your code from your local machine to your GitHub repository.

4. Pull from GitHub: If you're working with others, they might make changes to the code. To get those updates, you'll use:
    ```bash
    git pull
    ```
This command pulls the latest changes from the GitHub repository to your local machine.

5. Repeat and Collaborate: You can keep making changes, committing, and pushing to GitHub. When you're ready to share your work or collaborate with others, follow these steps.

This simplified Git workflow is a great starting point for managing your code, collaborating with others, and ensuring the safety and integrity of your projects. As you gain more experience, you can explore Git's many features and embrace its role as a fundamental part of your programming journey.

## Basic Git Workflow with VSCode

Visual Studio Code (VSCode) offers a seamless integration with Git, making it even easier to manage your code using the Git version control system. In this section, we'll walk through the same steps as the "Basic Git Workflow," but this time, we'll use the Git extension within VSCode.

1. **Add Files:** Open your project in VSCode. To tell Git which files to track, click on the Source Control icon in the left sidebar. You'll see a list of your changes and untracked files. Click the "+" icon next to the files you want to add, or click the "+" next to "Changes" to add all files.

2. **Commit Changes:** After adding the files, you can commit your changes directly from VSCode. In the Source Control tab, you'll find a text input box for your commit message. Enter a descriptive message, and then click the checkmark icon to commit. Commit messages are essential for understanding what changes were made.

3. **Sync Changes (i.e. Push & Pull):** To upload your project to GitHub, simply click on the "Sync Changes" button in the Source Control tab. This action will send your code from your local machine to your GitHub repository. If others are collaborating with you and have made changes to the code, VSCode also will fetch the latest changes from the GitHub repository and merge them into your local branch.

4. **Repeat and Collaborate:** You can continue making changes, committing, and syncing with GitHub as needed. The Git extension in VSCode simplifies the process and keeps your coding workflow streamlined.

By using the Git extension in VSCode, you can efficiently manage your code, collaborate with others, and ensure the safety and integrity of your projects. This integrated approach provides a seamless experience, allowing you to focus on the TTG-B without getting bogged down with remembering `git` commands. That being said, it's important to know how to use the command line, so we want to make sure you know how to do both.
