# Demonstrate usage of Linux commands

Using ONLY the Linux command line, complete the following. For each
task, record the flag you found and the commands you used to find it.

1. `ssh` into the local APS server using your trainee credentials
   (tr41n33:password). Can you find the flag for the user "ncwdg"?

   Note that you probably won't be able to perform the ssh from inside
   a VM, since it won't be on the APS network directly.

   While you're there, locate the .zip file in your home directory.

```text
flag:

commands:

```

2. From your local machine, use the `scp` command to copy the .zip
   file from the server. Again, you probably won't be able to do this
   from a VM. Once you get the .zip file locally, get it somewhere
   where you can use the Linux terminal to manipulate it, and unzip
   it.

```text
commands:

```

3. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file, recording all
   terminal commands you use.

```text
flag1:

commands:

flag2:

commands:

flag3:

commands:

```
